The hole was discovered by chance in 2011 on images of the dusty slopes of Mars' Pavonis Mons volcano taken by the HiRISE instrument aboard the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling Mars. The hole, shown in representative color, appears to be an opening to an underground cavern, partly illuminated on the image right.  Analysis of this and follow-up images revealed the opening to be about 35 meters across, while the interior shadow angle indicates that the underlying cavern is roughly 20 meters deep. Why there is a circular crater surrounding this hole remains a topic of speculation, as is the full extent of the underlying cavern. Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.","media_type":"image","title":"A Hole in Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/marshole2r_hirise_960.jpg","copyright":"public_domain","id":"March/0"},{"copyright":"ChilesopePleaides Astrophotography Team","date":"2020-03-02","explanation":"Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star, this cosmic bubble is much larger than the dolphin it appears to be. Cataloged as Sharpless 2-308 it lies some 5,200 light-years away toward the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major) and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon. That corresponds to a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance. The massive star that created the bubble, a Wolf-Rayet star, is the bright one near the center of the nebula. Wolf-Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova phase of massive star evolution. Fast winds from this Wolf-Rayet star create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution. The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000 years. Relatively faint emission captured in the featured expansive image is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms mapped to a blue hue.","media_type":"image","title":"Sharpless-308: The Dolphin Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/Dolphin_Pleiades_960.jpg","id":"March/1"},{"date":"2020-03-04","explanation":"If you like slow dances, then this may be one for you.  A single turn in this dance takes several hundred million years.  Two galaxies, NGC 5394 and NGC 5395, slowly whirl about each other in a gravitational interaction that sets off a flourish of sparks in the form of new stars.  The featured image, taken with the Gemini North 8-meter telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii, USA, combines four different colors.  Emission from hydrogen gas, colored red, marks stellar nurseries where new stars drive the evolution of the galaxies.  Also visible are dark dust lanes that mark gas that will eventually become stellar nurseries. If you look carefully you will see many more galaxies in the background, some involved in their own slow cosmic dances.
