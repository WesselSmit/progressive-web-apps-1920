# HIER MOET EEN SCREENSHOT KOMEN

# Assignment

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made at the OBA into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.

# Goal 
The goal of my app is to show users awesome space pictures, the app also provides a brief explanation by a professional. The app is a good place to find beautiful space pictures and/or show people how fascinating our universe is! 

# Install Notes

Clone the repository from Github

`https://github.com/WesselSmit/progressive-web-apps-1920.git`

Run the application with a code editor or host the source code with a service like github-pages.

# Features

<details><summary>Data Efficiency</summary>

This application retrieves many high resolution images, because these images do not change, they are not retrieved every time. The retrieved data is stored in `local JSON`. The next time the application is started, the application will look in the `local JSON`. There are 3 possible situations:

- **Data is empty** | all pictures of this year are `fetched` & stored in `local JSON`
- **Data is complete** | data is loaded from `local JSON`
- **Data exists but is incomplete** | data is loaded from `local JSON`, code determines what the most recent piece of data is, `fetches` missing data (uses most recent date in `local JSON` as startingpoint) & stores updated data in `local JSON`

This has 2 benefits:
- Reduces the number of `API` calls
- Only `fetches` missing data 

</details>

<details><summary>Data Saving</summary>

Not everything from the data that the `API` returns is important, all unnecessary data object keys are deleted. This means the application uses a more compact data object which enhances the performance, also resulting in a smaller JSON file.

</details>

<details><summary>Copyright Filter</summary>

This application allows the user to filter the pictures by copyright. The available filter options are:
- **copyright** | show only the copyrighted pictures
- **non-copyright** | show only the non-copyright pictures (public domain owns theses pictures)
- **all** | show all pictures

This features helps users find usable pictures for their own work/projects.

</details>

# API

This application uses NASA's [Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://api.nasa.gov/) `API`, it provides space related pictures.

Every day NASA adds a new space related picture to the `API`, these are retrievable individually but NASA also supports bulk fetching!

Using parameters you're able to create a more personal request, the following parameters are available;
* **date** | the date of the picture 
* **hd** | url for high resolution picture
* **api_key** | personal api key to identify yourself 

There currently is 1000 calls per hour (per `api` key).

`API` keys are free, you only have to [register](https://api.nasa.gov/) (full name & email).

# Data 
The received data from NASA's APOD `API` that I use:
* **date** | APOD date 
* **title** | title for the APOD
* **hdurl** | high resolution url to image
* **explanation** | explanation of the image by a professional
* **copyright** | copyright owner

## Data cleaning

Because the data is stored it's important the data is as small as possible so no unnessacary space is being wasted. In the cleaning `module` all properties that won't be used are `deleted`, the following properties are deleted:
* service_version
* media_type

The `API` consists of images & videos, all videos are filtered out.

> There aren't that many videos, approximately 15% of the APODs are of media_type **video**.

All APODs are assigned an unique ID.

The data contains no empty values, but data objects only contain the `copyright` key if they are copyrighted. In the code all data objects without the `copyright` key are assigned the `copyright: public domain` key/value pair.

# Best Practices
* Code should be easily readable
* Only use shorthands if you really understand how they work
* Stick to a code style you understand and can apply consistently
* Add comments
* Use descriptive `variable`-/`function` names
* Only abbreviate words when instantly understandable
* Commit early and often
* Save JS selectors as variables (`const button = document.querySelector('button')`)
* Group code/logic based on functionality in `modules` 
* Name `modules` after `objects` & name `functions` after `actions`
* Try to avoid using `global` `variables` 

# Stuff I Want To Do

- [ ] Add pagination based on available months
